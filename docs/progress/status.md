## Current focus

- Phase 0 (contracts): define schemas + golden examples.

## Done

- PRD digested and translated into architecture + safety + UI docs.
- OpenCode + nanobot feasibility assessed (local clones + code references).
- Competitive analysis vs OpenClaw completed; positioning decided (Windows local productivity + coding).
- Contract-first plan documented.
- Contracts created: JSON Schemas + TS types + golden examples.

## In progress

- None (next step not started).

## Next

1) Build stub sidecars that emit contract-conformant streams.
2) Build Desktop bottom layer: sidecar supervisor + event normalization + permission gate + audit log.
3) Build frontend against contract mocks.
4) Run demo milestones M0 -> M2 for early feedback (`jarvis/docs/25-demo-milestones.md`).

## Open questions

- None required to start stubs and Desktop supervisor.
