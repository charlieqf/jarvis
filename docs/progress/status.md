## Current focus

- Milestone 1 demo implementation (interactive fake flow).

## Done

- PRD digested and translated into architecture + safety + UI docs.
- OpenCode + nanobot feasibility assessed (local clones + code references).
- Competitive analysis vs OpenClaw completed; positioning decided (Windows local productivity + coding).
- Contract-first plan documented.
- Contracts created: JSON Schemas + TS types + golden examples.
- M1 desktop demo scaffolded (`desktop/`) with contract-replay UI.
- M1 demo build passes (`npm run build` in `desktop/`).
- Scripted replay scenarios added for repeatable M1 demos (general + code).

## In progress

- Prepare and run M1 user demo sessions with scripted tasks.

## Next

1) Run M1 user feedback sessions (3-5 users) using scripted tasks.
2) Add event replay script packs for repeatable demo scenarios.
3) Start M2: sidecar stubs + Desktop supervisor (dynamic fake).

## Open questions

- None required to start stubs and Desktop supervisor.
