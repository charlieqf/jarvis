# Progress Tracking

This folder exists so we can answer, at any time:

- What is done?
- What is currently in progress?
- What is blocked?
- What are the next 1-3 highest-leverage steps?

## Files

- `jarvis/docs/progress/status.md`
  - Always-current snapshot of status.

- `jarvis/docs/progress/progress-log.md`
  - Append-only log of milestones reached (dated).

## Update rules

- Update `status.md` whenever a milestone is completed or scope changes.
- Append to `progress-log.md` whenever you ship a testable demo increment.
- Keep updates short and factual (no long narratives).
